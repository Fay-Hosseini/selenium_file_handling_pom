When you get a task like *“create a Selenium (Python) project to practice file handling with POM”*, the best way to start is to break it down into **three layers of planning** before you start writing any code.

---

## **1. Understand & clarify requirements**

Before touching your editor, you should know:

* **Main goal**: Practice both Selenium automation and Python file handling.
* **Constraints**: Must use POM (Page Object Model) structure.
* **Deliverables**: A runnable project — likely with `requirements.txt`, project structure, and one or more working tests.
* **Scope**: Is it just a proof of concept or production-like?
* **Test site**: Use a stable demo site (like `the-internet.herokuapp.com`) to avoid flakiness.

💡 *Tip:* Ask the person assigning the task to confirm expected tech stack (Selenium + pytest? unittest? headless mode?).

## **2. Design your project skeleton first**

Don’t start with a long test — start by creating the **folders & files** you’ll need, even if they’re empty.

Example plan:

```
project/
├── pages/          # POM classes
├── utils/          # File handling helpers
├── tests/          # Your test scripts
├── data/           # Test data (CSV, JSON)
├── requirements.txt
└── conftest.py     # Fixtures for Selenium setup
```

Why?
Because this:

* Forces you to think about **separation of concerns** (UI actions in `pages`, logic in `tests`, helpers in `utils`).
* Makes it easy to expand later without messy refactoring.

---

## **3. Plan your feature flow**

A good habit is to sketch your automation flow in plain English **before** coding:

1. Read login credentials from a CSV.
2. Open browser → Go to login page.
3. For each set of credentials:

   * Fill in username/password.
   * Click login.
   * Capture success/failure message.
4. Save results to a new CSV.

Once the flow is clear, **decide the mapping**:

* **Page Objects** handle UI steps (LoginPage, SecureAreaPage).
* **Utils** handle reading/writing files.
* **Tests** orchestrate reading data → calling pages → writing results.

### **Workflow when starting such tasks**

1. **Confirm** requirements and constraints.
2. **Create folder structure** & placeholder files.
3. **Write basic Page Object classes** (empty methods with `pass` if needed).
4. **Write file handling utilities** independently (can test them without Selenium).
5. **Write one happy-path test** to connect the pieces.
6. **Run the test** → fix any broken imports or selectors.
7. Add more cases & polish.

---

If you follow this sequence, you’ll avoid the “giant spaghetti test file” trap and end up with a clean, extensible project.

If you want, I can give you a **10–15 min checklist** that I use for starting any Selenium+POM project so you can hit the ground running every time. Would you like me to make that?
